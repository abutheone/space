        <p>"Hi! I'm Adam, though many of you might know me as 'CookieByte_abu' from the CTF competitions I started participating
            in a decade ago. Today, I'm here with my team, representing one of the top blue teams in the world. My journey
            wouldn't have been possible without my dedication and hard work. The spark for my career began back in my days
            at GMI, when my lecturer, Sir Hazly, assigned us a project to create a 'Short Essay to Yourself' in HTML. That's
            where my milestones began."</p>
